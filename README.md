# Chess

An attemp to create a chess environment with C++ and SDL2. The project is still being worked on, check [issues](https://github.com/ErtyumPX/chess/issues) and [milestones](https://github.com/ErtyumPX/chess/milestones) for the process.

## License

This project is licensed under the [GNU GPL-3.0](https://github.com/ErtyumPX/chess/blob/main/LICENSE) license.

## Setup

Project is currently compiled with GNU G++ 13.2.1.

The only third-party dependency is SDL2. Used version of SDL2 in project is 2.28.5, should work as long as it is `SDL2` and not `SDL`.

For compiling and linking rules GNU Make 4.4.1 was used. After downloading dependencies, make sure to change the include paths inside the Makefile.

```
# change the paths for '-I' 
CC := g++
CFLAGS := -Wall -std=c++11 -I/usr/include/SDL2           # here
TEST_CFLAGS := -Wall -std=c++11 -Iinclude/SDL2 -Isrc/    # and here
LDFLAGS := -lSDL2 -lSDL2_image
...
```

After fulfilling dependencies, download or clone the project and use Makefile to easily compile:

```
> make all
> make run
```

To run tests and check if everything works:

```
> make test
```

Since SDL2 is a cross-platform media library, output should work on Windows, MacOS and Linux.


## Project

For now, looks like this:
